## Core Features:

- AI Tutoring: Use the Gemini API to generate explanations, examples, and practice problems for engineering topics, tailoring the depth and pace based on the user's specified urgency. Gemini acts as a tool to decide what content to include based on the urgency, learning progress and doubts of the user.
- Structured Content Display: Display the topic outline, subtopics, explanations, examples, and practice problems in a structured and easy-to-navigate format. Provide a clear interface for users to input their urgency level, select topics, and ask questions.
